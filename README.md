## The tutorial

This repo is for [a video tutorial by Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/jJgNgNNHqjk) taking on [Frontend Mentor's challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/contact-form--G-hYlqKJj?via=kevinpowell) of creating the form above.

This tutorial only includes the styling of the form. [This follow-up explores the error handling](https://github.com/kevin-powell/fem-contact-form-validation).

## Following along

### The Files

This repo is my the finished code. If you would like to follow along from where I start my demo, there is a `style-STARTING.css` file, and my HTML file was empty.

If you'd prefer to start from scratch, you can refer to [the original challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/contact-form--G-hYlqKJj?via=kevinpowell).
